# Path_Finder

# Getting Started/Installation
Pretty much the same as the standard react application, so all the usual react-scripts are available to your disposal. So, over here I restricted myself to the instructions to only the essentials.
## 1. Clone the repository or download the zip
```
git clone https://github.com/Sethuram52001/Path-Finding-Visualizer.git
```

## 2. Install the dependencies
```
npm install
```

## 3. Start the application
```
npm start
```
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
